# Katipo Browser

Katipo is a minimal internet alternative. A free and open platform that lives entirely outside of the existing HTML/CSS/JS based web.

This is the repository for the client browser, an app that can be installed to connect to sites hosted on a Katipo network. The Katipo equivalent of Safari, Chrome or Firefox.

For more information about Katipo networks generally and what this is all about, have a look at the [Katipo core networking library repository](https://github.com/mjdave/katipo).

More information and build instructions will be added here soon. This is a very early release, the browser is bare bones and a little buggy, but it will improve quickly.

For now, you can build Katipo Browser for iOS, macOS, and Windows, and it won't be too much effort to get it working on Linux.

There are only very limited examples available, but there are 3 example hosts in the katipo repository, and you can also find the MP3 player app that I am working on currently [here](https://github.com/mjdave/daves-katipo-sites), and I'll be adding more apps soon. If you get that running on a desktop PC or server, you can then connect to it in the browser and listen to music.

Please be a little careful. Katipo is designed with security in mind first and foremost, however there are currently bugs and missing details making it a little unsecure in certain ways.

Any questions, please reach out via email or bluesky for now, hopefully via katipo one day soon.
